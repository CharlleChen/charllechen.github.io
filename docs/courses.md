This page is an overview of the courses I have taken. As a Honors Math and Computer Science major student, I took several graduate-level advanced CS courses and a lot of honors undergraduate courses. I always feel motivated to learn challenging new knowledge.

## Advanced Graduate Courses
- Foundations of Machine Learning (Prof. Mohri Mehryar)

    Prove machine learning bounds for common models like linear regression, maximum entropy, boosting, etc.

    This is really a hard course (probably target at PhD students). A lot of math tricks, statistic bounds, information theory...
    
- Convex and Nonsmooth Optimization (Prof. Michael Overton)

    Learn classical algorithms to optimize convex and nonsmooth problems

- Computer Graphics (Prof. Daniele Panozzo)

    Learn and implement raytracing and rasterization algorithms in C++


## Computer Science Courses

- Operating System (Prof. Michael Walfish)

    Virtual Memory, Assembly, vim/gdb, scheduling...

    I really love Mike's courses. He's so passionate in teaching and meticulous with students and himself. I learn a lot from him besides a bunch of OS knowledge. In the first few classes, he said, people knew that hard training (often accompanied with pain) was required for athelete to improve performance, but they just forgot this when this came to studying. This is a paraphrasing to "no pain, no gain", but I remember this till today and still motivate myself with this.

- Basic Algorithms (Prof. Areeba Ikram)

## Math Courses


- Honors Analysis I & II (Prof. S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan and Prof. Sinan Gunturk respectively)

    Real analysis: limits, continuity and differentiability, convergence, ...

    Analysis is hard but interesting and satisfying (if understand)

- Honors Numerical Analysis (Prof. Mike O'Neil)

    Introduction to fundamental numerical methods: machine precision, quadratures, optimizations...

    "Numerical is magic" --me

- Honors Linear Algebra (Prof. Sinan Gunturk)

    Image and kernel, rank, determinant, eigenvalue and eigenvectors, dual space, ...

- Theory of Computation (Prof. Yuri Bakhtin)

    Common probability distributions

## My schedule for Fall 2022 (tentative)

-  Mathematical Statistics (Graduate level) (Prof. Jonoathon Niles-Weed)

    Probability bound, concentration inequality, asymptotic bounds, ...

- Advanced Statistical Inference and Machine Learning (Graduate level) (Prof. Gordon)

    Bayesion statistics, Generalized Linear Model, Hidden Markov Models, ...

- Honors I: Fourier Analysis (Prof. Jalal Shatah)

    My friend who took a lot of hard math courses said this is the best course he has ever taken

- Honors Algebra I (Prof. Sylvain Cappell)

    Abstract algebratic structures: groups, rings, fields, ...
