Hi, my name is Charlie, a rising junior at NYUðŸ’œ, majoring in honors joint math and computer science. I am passionate about engineering and mathematics. I love solving problems with modern technology and spending hours on hard math problems. I enjoy seeing my works become reality and I don't mind struggling in something beautiful but profound. Below is a partial list of the courses I have taken and work I have done. You can check a more thorough course list [here](courses.html).
